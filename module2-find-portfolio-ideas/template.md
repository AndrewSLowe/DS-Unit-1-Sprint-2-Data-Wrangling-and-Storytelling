## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
What are the screentime breakdowns by geography? How much do people use screens by georgraphy, what kinds of screens are people using in different parts of the country (e.g. smartphones, televisions, monitors, laptops)? 

2. Trend related to the news
People constantly talk about generational divides and milennials in many conceptual or speculative ways. Well here is some a real generational divide! People's media consuption is very different by age. 

3. Who does that?
Everyone.

4. Answering a question people care about
It's interesting, at the very least.

5. Valuable to businesses
It might help with targeted ads by location.

6. What's the most popular?
In which states do people watch television the most? --- this would be proportionately to watching on mobile devices.

7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
People might assume that across the board people have moved to streaming services when, in fact, older generations still do much more of their viewing on televisions, and use Youtube at MUCH lower rates than young people.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
I might have to compile the data myself. The tricky part will be determining what variables to use. I'm thinking wealth of city/neighborhood/state, college attended, and location.
